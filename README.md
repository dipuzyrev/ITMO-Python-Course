### Dmitry Puzyrev

I'm a student of ITMO University in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I have little experience in developing websites, mostly front-end part. Now I am learning Python and Django.

And... of course, it's my repository of computer science homework. I advice you don't explore it, if you don't want to be shocked by my learning spaghetti code ;)

**It's all. Thanks.**
